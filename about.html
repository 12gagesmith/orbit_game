      <p>This is obviously mostly html copied from the Simon html. I've changed a couple things such as
        the name of each page as well as some other text, but not much. I will definitely change a lot more
        to make the html my own, but for now I have copied it to give me a baseline to work from.

        Orbit Game, based on Orbito, is a game where you try to get four marbles of your colour in a
        horizontal, vertical or diagonal row on a shifting game board. But watch out! At the end of
        your turn, ALL marbles shift 1 position on their orbit! Moreover, you can also disrupt your
        opponent's strategy by moving one of their marbles on your turn.

        The name Orbito is a registered trademark of FlexIQ Games. My use of the name and the game is for non-profit
        educational use only. No part of this code or program should be used outside of that definition.
