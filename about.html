        Orbit Game, based on Orbito, is a game where you try to get four marbles of your colour in a
        horizontal, vertical or diagonal row on a shifting game board. But watch out! At the end of
        your turn, ALL marbles shift 1 position on their orbit! Moreover, you can also disrupt your
        opponent's strategy by moving one of their marbles on your turn.

        educational use only. No part of this code or program should be used outside of that definition.
